# Common principles or requirements for implementing MFEs effectively 

## 1. Independent Deployability:
- **Description:** Each micro frontend should be independently deployable without affecting other parts of the system.

- **Implementation:** 
    - Use independent CI/CD pipelines for each MFE.
    - Ensure versioning and backward compatibility for shared APIs or libraries.

- **Why?** This allows teams to release features, bug fixes, or updates for specific MFEs without requiring a rebuild or redeployment of the entire system.


## 2. Isolation of Business Logic:
- **Description:** Each MFE should encapsulate its business logic and avoid sharing state or logic with other MFEs.

- **Implementation:** 
    - Avoid shared global variables or states.
    - Use APIs, events, or message queues for communication between MFEs.

- **Why?** To maintain clear boundaries between responsibilities, reduce dependency issues, and avoid tight coupling.

## 3. Autonomous Teams:
- **Description:** Each MFE should be managed by a dedicated team responsible for its development, testing, and deployment.

- **Implementation:** 
    - Follow domain-driven design (DDD) principles to assign MFEs to specific domains.

    - Allow teams to use the technology stack best suited for their MFE (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).


- **Why?** Enables faster development and deployment cycles and encourages specialization and accountability.

## 4. Seamleass User Experience:
- **Description:**  Despite being composed of multiple independent MFEs, the overall application should provide a consistent and seamless user experience.

- **Implementation:** 
    - Use a shared design system for consistent UI components.

    - Ensure smooth transitions and interactions between MFEs.


- **Why?**  To avoid confusing the user and maintain a cohesive application look and feel.


## 5. Shared Resources (When Necessary):
- **Description:**   Share common libraries or assets (e.g., React, utilities, design systems) only when it benefits performance and reduces duplication.
- **Implementation:** 
    - Use shared configurations in Webpack's Module Federation.

    - Maintain backward compatibility for shared libraries.


- **Why?**  To optimize bundle size and reduce overhead without creating tight coupling.


## 6. Resilience and Fault Tolerance:
- **Description:**   The failure of one MFE should not bring down the entire system.
- **Implementation:** 
    - Use fallback mechanisms or default content for failed MFEs.

    - Monitor and isolate errors in specific MFEs without affecting others.


- **Why?**  To enhance system reliability and user experience.


## 7. Framework Agnostic:
- **Description:** The container and MFEs should not depend on a specific framework, allowing each MFE to choose its preferred stack.
- **Implementation:** 
    - Use Webpack's Module Federation or iframe-based integration.

    - Avoid tightly coupled dependencies.


- **Why?**  This ensures flexibility and prevents framework lock-in.



## 8. Versioning and Backward Compatibility:
- **Description:** Ensure that updates to shared libraries or APIs do not break existing MFEs.

- **Implementation:** 
    - Use semantic versioning (^, ~) for shared libraries.

    - Maintain backward-compatible APIs and deprecate features gracefully.



- **Why?**   To enable smooth updates and reduce the risk of regressions.


## 9. Communication via Standard Protocols:
- **Description:** MFEs should communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces like events, APIs, or props (in case of React-based MFEs).

- **Implementation:** 
    - Use an event bus or custom events for communication.

    - Use an event bus or custom events for communication.


- **Why?**   To ensure decoupled and predictable interactions.


## 10.  Granularity of MFEs:
- **Description:** Each MFE should represent a meaningful and cohesive domain or feature (e.g.,home page, product description , cart, product list).

- **Implementation:** 
    - Break the application into logically grouped features.

    - Avoid creating excessively small or large MFEs.


- **Why?**   To balance development overhead and scalability.


## Example Scenario for Micro Frontend Implementation:
1. Container App:
    - Provides the main layout, routing, and shared resources.
    - Example: React-based container that hosts a navigation bar and loads MFEs dynamically.

2. Child Apps:

    - **Product List MFE:** Displays a list of products.
    - **Cart MFE:**  Manages the user's shopping cart.
    - **Checkout MFE:** Handles payment and order submission.
